# oui_chef
This project focuses on automation, organization, and efficiency in the culinary space, using python, sql, html, terraform and javascript.
The goal is to create a system where I can easily automate certain aspects of being a chef, like creating prep lists, check list, writting emails for ordering and organizing menus.
This system will eventually hosted in the cloud via AWS cloud services and routinely updated and improved via terraform.
